# Since we're doing a GWAS, we can estimate genomic control lambda from the analysis,
# and then adjust each study by its genomic control lambda, 
# we would uncomment this line:
GENOMICCONTROL ON

# To help identify allele flips, it can be useful to track
# allele frequencies in the meta-analysis.  To do that, we can
# uncomment the next two lines:
AVERAGEFREQ ON
MINMAXFREQ ON
